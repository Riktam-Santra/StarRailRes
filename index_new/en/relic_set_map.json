But when the rhythm of light and darkness slowed down, day and night were no longer familiar, and the seemingly eternal heat and coldness were like the quagmire of hell, slowly burying all lives entrapped within. This was why the Salsottian people, barely surviving at the time, boarded the floating mobile city and began their chase with dawn and dusk.<br /><br />Climbing atop the observation deck of the mobile city of Tumbleweed and looking in the direction that they were moving, daylight lies ahead and dark night behind.<br /><br />The pursuit of \"Tumbleweed\" is not only for survival but also for a dignified life.

Wherever it went, overwhelming storms of sand were cascading down and over. In the giant moving city, the Salsottians in winged suits were flying up and down among the city's buildings. These flying folks who had survived the calamity by sheer luck now belonged to the sky and were bound to it at the same time.<br /><br />In the morning, skyfishers departed from the port and dove right for the sand, where they would hunt the phlogiston jellyfish. They would only return to the city after dusk. By the power of mysterious creatures, the city barely managed to voyage ahead.<br /><br />Even though their entire survival relied squarely on those two fragile wings, the Salsottians were optimistic by nature and would never let the heavy burden of fate lower their spirit or bend their spine. They would find time to spend with their family playing glass musical instruments, with such an attitude that it was almost as if they could carve the musical notes right into the glass. They also enjoyed making pen pals and would often place their written messages in the Dandelion Letterbox, meant for the moving city on the other end of the terminator line.<br /><br />Gradually, the planet's magnetic field weakened and the atmosphere thinned.

The planet-destroying wars of the past brought mountains upon mountains of ruins and wreckage onto the surface of Talia, resulting in imperishable radiation and taking away the last remaining hope to sustain life. The thieves had nowhere else to go and fell into a cave beneath the surface of the planet, which turned out to be a tunnel left by the rodent race... The thieves managed a narrow escape, and their dream of establishing a Kingdom of Banditry was thus discreetly born in this lost realm of seclusion.<br /><br />Innumerable caverns were interconnected in a massive labyrinth. More groups of thieves and bandits were lured in by this supposed dreamland meant for them and came to accumulate wealth and exchange technology, subsequently laying the foundation for the kingdom.<br /><br />As more and more thieves and bandits settled down here, the once desolate planet became extraordinarily bustling with life. Thieves of great renown spoke of their ideal of a Kingdom of Banditry, promising to use the treasury to build a nation of equity and fairness. But as the amount of accumulated wealth grew larger and larger, the same thieves tore up their flimsy promises right away and attempted to monopolize all the wealth. Mercenaries, riots, double crossings, and betrayals... Chaos ensued one after another. Perhaps the initiators never even once believed in their ideal of so-called equity for all.<br /><br />Henceforth, thieves who resented lofty ideals found themselves in a chaotic age where ignorance was glorified. They seized water sources to build towns of their own and mocked the very idea of fairness and justice.<br /><br />Everyone in Nailscrap Town was a bandit. They drove violently destructive off-road vehicles and fought for resources with other hordes of bandits in the desert. They created mechanical armor and weapons out of scrap iron and old wires... The more barren the wasteland was, the more freedom they got out of it, like one final frenzy before doomsday. Those sweet dreams were like wisps of nonsense in the radiating heat waves and had long ceased to leave any trace behind.<br /><br />In a half-awake trance, the thieves came to the realization that the Kingdom of Banditry was never about creation but about destruction."

On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds...<br /><br />This exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source.<br /><br />The top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion.<br /><br />This naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits. The aging wire caused the lights to flicker frequently.<br /><br />It was an old gangster who claimed to be the \"police officer\" who founded the original Nailscrap Town. With his strongarm tactics and charisma, he managed to keep the junkyard in good order. The town became livelier than ever. Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival.<br /><br />There was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times."

The support team prepared an adequate fleet, rare and precious goods, and offers that were hard to refuse, thus creating countless trades across star systems. Then, the support team controlled trade route and business information, held exclusive bargaining rights, and spearheaded the formulation of the Galaxy's trade regulations.<br /><br />Fleets full of wood, stone, rebar, and supernium passed by Aeon Qlipoth like a swarm of circling flies. The Amber Lord kept silent, never once casting their gaze upon the humans.<br /><br />Eventually, times changed and trade with neighboring star systems was no longer sufficient for the bustling support team. The two wise ones were determined to delve deeper into the galaxy, and thus the Interastral Peace Corporation was born. The IPC offered anything a planet could ever want, at fair prices pegged to their \"credits.\" Since then, the Galaxy's trade route was founded, and all planets that join the IPC's business network can share the same currency, buy the same goods, and enjoy the same services.<br /><br />Merchant ships under the credit system travel between the stars, and the trade routes merge and separate to weave a pan-galactic network. The ships full of treasures from distant stars passed the Aeon Qlipoth countless times like fireflies, and yet the Aeon remained as silent as before.<br /><br />The building materials accumulated since the time of the support team piled up on every planet around the Aeon Qlipoth, and the amount will only increase. The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light years. The small organization that used to purchase materials has long since become a tremendous influence in the Galaxy. They gaze upon the headless colossus, never once feeling that their efforts were in vain.<br /><br />\"All the toil and growth of our capital is for Qlipoth, and to execute the Aeon's will when the time comes.\""

Those who claimed to have received the oracle of the god began to act, wishing to help the Aeon Qlipoth to build the wall.<br /><br />The universe is in imminent peril, and the building of the wall cannot wait. The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed \"support team\" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord. With the power of the Preservation, the support team piloted their fleet to different galaxies to purchase building materials such as stone, wood, gold, and supernium, then tirelessly transported these to the subspace barrier, piling the items on the planetary wasteland.<br /><br />After the end of the short development period, the support team took a firm foothold in Pier Point and established the Interastral Peace Corporation. In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space.<br /><br />Louis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Galaxy and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Galaxy-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe. Trillions of assets gathered under their megastructure on Pier Point. Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth.<br /><br />Today, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the galaxy. Despite being criticized as a corporate dictatorship, the IPC has not stopped expanding. They don't care what other people think and have never forgotten their founding mission.<br /><br />The IPC's recruit training methods change with each passing day, but after nearly eight hundred Amber Eras, there is only one historical practice that never changed. Once upon a time, Louis Fleming, the founder of the IPC, stood in front of the support team and made a passionate speech. He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe. As soon as the speech ended, the distant and huge sound of a galactic impact sounded, injecting a lofty calling into this solemn and sublime moment. From that moment on, they knew this would become their unswerving belief.<br /><br />\"All in the name of the Amber Lord.\""

The event of understanding the operation logic of Planet Screwllum did not even cause any exceptional fluctuations in his Intelligent Pulse Waveform.<br /><br />He stood on the wide terrace of his mansion, looking up at the unstoppable planetary engine. The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day. He had seen the despairingly absurd nature of this planetary system: An elegant string of state transient equations, a giant, icy cylinder — that's all Planet Screwllum is, nothing more.<br /><br />According to his interpretation of the equations, at the birth of the Celestial Differentiator, its lead creator tried to explain the origin of the universe as a cellular automaton and its recursion, and Planet Screwllum itself was a result of the game of life.<br /><br />Screwllumites and other inorganic life on the planet acted as the \"cells\" in this automaton, while also being smaller-scale cellular automatons. Automatons were always made up of many smaller automatons, going back to the smallest components that form the building blocks of the universe. What was the smallest component? No one knows.

The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. Do ends to recursions really exist? He thought. What is the nature of inorganic life — or yet, what is the origin of the universe?<br /><br />Am I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors?<br /><br />\"No,\" Screwllum concluded.

According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.<br /><br />A mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.<br /><br />However, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.<br /><br />In the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.<br /><br />With their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.<br /><br />The massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.<br /><br />The steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits.

                "lore": "Vonwacq is a small and crowded planet, almost entirely covered by rainforests and islands, with its exuberant wildlife being its most recognizable feature.<br /><br />Vonwacq's effervescent vitality made the rainforests near its equator grow so large and tall that their shades would cover the sky above and even block out the sun. The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on.<br /><br />However, be it the new immigrants or the indigenous Wacqwacq beings, they have always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree.<br /><br />The great Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.<br /><br />The fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others, waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq.<br /><br />Every sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a new demon king, and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island... One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out.<br /><br />Thus, it could be said that Planet Vonwacq was more like a stagnating pool of dead water, even though it was teeming with lively creatures that were ceaselessly fighting with each other, seemingly full of possibilities for change."

Then these creatures awakened, cried, and subsequently left Wacq Island to seek a habitat of their own on Planet Vonwacq.<br /><br />At first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.<br /><br />As the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.<br /><br />When the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.<br /><br />The demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.<br /><br />The sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.<br /><br />The coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration."

In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.<br /><br />After voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of the Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.<br /><br />Those who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.<br /><br />Yet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.<br /><br />In the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The Foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.<br /><br />Prosperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.<br /><br />Immortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu.

From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.<br /><br />However, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.<br /><br />The celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.<br /><br />In desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.<br /><br />It attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of the Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.<br /><br />Fortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree.

In hazy memories of the olden days, he finally made up his mind to gift his bosom friend with his hand-made jade flask, only to realize with a shock that the person he longed for was no longer there.<br /><br />He realized that everything he relied on to walk this earth — this body, this life, this love and hatred, and even this set of clothes — were just loaned items.<br /><br />He will repay all of them in full, then draw his last breath."
